# Pollinations AI Web App: Comprehensive Project Roadmap

This document provides an actionable, interwoven development roadmap. Phases 1 and 3 are **merged and sequenced** so that both essentials (security, accessibility, onboarding) and high-value UX/engagement tasks are completed up front. **Production launch (Phase 2) occurs only after all Phase 1 & Phase 3 tasks are finished.**

---

## ðŸš¦ Development & User Experience Upgrade Phase (Phase 1 + Phase 3 Interwoven)

### Current
- **In-App Creative Challenges & Tutorials**
  - Guide both new and power users via challenge activities, clearly showcasing app capabilities and creative potential.
  - Implement framework for challenge creation, management, and display (rotating/curated prompt set).
  - Design UX to present current challenges in an engaging, accessible format.
  - Add step-by-step tutorial overlays/guides integrated into the challenge flow.
  - Collect and optionally showcase user submissions/solutions.
  - Document developer/admin flow for adding and updating challenges or tutorials.

### Done
- [x] **Restrict CORS Policy to Preview/Test Domain(s)**
  - Limit `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to current preview/test domain and localhost.
  - Update for each testing or demo deployment. Review upon domain changes.

- [x] **Scope Static Server Directory (Public Assets Only)**
  - Ensure only assets necessary for the app (HTML, JS, CSS, images) are web-exposed.
  - Never expose `.env`, config, or source files.

- [x] **Add Prominent Security Warning**
  - Update README and in-app banner: "This deployment uses a temporary API key. Do not share this link."
  - Clarify removal of API key and domain restriction steps at launch.

- [x] **Monitor API Key Usage**
  - Regularly check for unusual API calls with Pollinations dashboard.
  - Prepare to rotate the key at any sign of misuse.

### Accessibility and Onboarding
- **Audit Keyboard Navigation, Focus Order, ARIA**
  - Tab/shift-tab through all controls; ensure clear focus states and screen reader labels.

- **Add Color Contrast & Theme Toggle**
  - Implement dark/light mode options.
  - Validate all text meets WCAG AA contrast guidelines.

- **Visible Progress Feedback**
  - Ensure every background/generation task shows a progress bar, spinner, or status indicator.

- **Quick Start Guide in README**
  - List clone/run/browse/deploy steps.
  - Add troubleshooting section for devs and testers.

- **In-App Tutorials & Onboarding Guide**
  - Create a step-by-step overlay for first-time users, highlighting key features and safety reminders.

### Testing & Collaboration
- **Basic Unit/E2E Tests for Core Logic**
  - Create Jest (frontend) and Pytest (backend) tests for main flows.
  - Add a single CI pass if feasible on your platform.

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**
  - Define PR, doc, and simple code/test expectations.

### User Experience & Delight
- **Personalized Style Profiles**
  - Allow users to save, load, and manage named style/model presets.

- **In-App Creative Challenges & Tutorials**
  - Guide both new and power users via challenges, showcasing app potential.

- **Visual Inspiration Feed / Community Gallery**
  - Provide a browsable, infinite-scroll gallery of image+prompt pairs from users.

- **Collaborative Prompt Workshops**
  - Enable remixing and discussion of prompts, fostering creativity and community learning.

- **Advanced Accessibility & Inclusive UI**
  - "Simpler UI" mode for cognitive accessibility.
  - Ensure all features available by voice, keyboard, or screen reader.

### Internationalization
- **Minimal Localization**
  - Translate UI into at least one additional language.
  - Use language files/arrays to support future expansion.

## ðŸš€ Production Launch Phase (Phase 2 â€” Execute Only After Above)

- **Remove API Key & Register Production Domain**
  - Remove all API keys from client/server and repo.
  - Set up Pollinations for domain-based authentication.

- **Finalize CORS Policy for Production**
  - Allow only the live domain you own.
  - Remove all test/localhost CORS rules.

- **Confirm Static Asset Exposure (Final Scan)**
  - Double-check only public HTML/JS/CSS/images are being served or hosted.

- **Review and Update All Documentation**
  - Ensure onboarding, warning, usage, and contributor guides are up-to-date.
  - Remove any language or code referring to "beta" or "test".

---

## âœ… Post-Launch & Continuous Enhancement

- **Iterate Based on User Feedback**
  - Review analytics, survey early users, and adjust priorities.
- **Expand Community Features**
  - Progressively implement more advanced sharing, community, and personalization ideas.
- **Ongoing Security & Performance Audits**
  - Schedule regular reviews to address dependencies, accessibility, and operational risks.

---

### **Key Notes for Execution**

- Blockers: No production deployment unless all interwoven security, onboarding, accessibility, and core-UX tasks are complete.
- Each listed item should have an associated issue or ticket before work begins.
- Reassess phases as needed per user and operational stress test feedback.
